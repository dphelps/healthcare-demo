# MIMIC Critical Care Datathon

These are training materials for the MIMIC Critical Care Database. The package includes:

- a demo version of MIMIC.
- an IPython Notebook which connects to the demo MIMIC database and allows analysis to be carried out using Python.

## What is MIMIC-III?

MIMIC-III is a widely-used, freely available dataset developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, comprising deidentified health data associated with >40,000 critical care patients. It includes demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, and more. Details are available on the MIMIC website: https://mimic.physionet.org/

## Class overview 

During the class, you will:

- Learn about Healthcare Analytics
- Learn about MIMIC-III, the publicly accessible critical care database 
- Clone a local version a sample MIMIC-III database
- Explore the patient data using SQL
- Plot and analyse the data using Python
- Get inspiration for future research projects

## Downloading the materials

If you are familiar with git, please clone this repository. If not, click the
'Download ZIP' button on the right and then unzip the materials onto your
computer.

## Analysing the data using IPython Notebook

To analyse the data using IPython Notebook:

- Open the IPython Notebook '01-example-patient-heart-failure.ipynb' found in the intro_to_mimic directory.
