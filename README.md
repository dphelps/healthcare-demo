# MIMIC Critical Care Datathon

These are training materials for the MIMIC Critical Care Database. The package includes:

- a demo version of MIMIC.
- an IPython Notebook which connects to the demo MIMIC database and allows analysis to be carried out using Python.

## What is MIMIC-III?

MIMIC-III is a widely-used, freely available dataset developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, comprising deidentified health data associated with >40,000 critical care patients. It includes demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, and more. Details are available on the MIMIC website: https://mimic.physionet.org/

## Class overview 

During the class, you will:

- Learn about Healthcare Analytics
- Learn about MIMIC-III, the publicly accessible critical care database 
- Clone a local version a sample MIMIC-III database
- Explore the patient data using SQL
- Plot and analyse the data using Python
- Get inspiration for future research projects

## Downloading the materials

If you are familiar with git, please clone this repository. If not, click the
'Download ZIP' button on the right and then unzip the materials onto your
